	abstract = {Citizen developers, individuals outside formal IT departments who create applications using low-code/no-code platforms, are becoming increasingly pivotal as organizations navigate digital transformation. The driving force behind this paradigm shift stems from an exponentially growing demand for software solutions that consistently outpaces traditional IT departments’ capacity. Consequently, companies are turning their attention toward citizen developers, entrusting them with crafting solutions. In this work, we perform a systematic review of the existing literature to unearth the pivotal themes and subthemes and identify the factors contributing to citizen developers’ effectiveness. Our systematic review revealed a signiﬁcant gap in scholarly understanding of factors contributing to citizen developers’ effectiveness. While some studies touched on these factors, none explored them comprehensively or provided an integrated framework for understanding their interrelationships. To ﬁll this void, we propose a conceptual model to advance the understanding of the factors that inﬂuence the effectiveness of citizen developers in creating applications. While the model contributes to the theoretical understanding of citizen development, practical implications further reinforce its value. By leveraging the model, organizations can make informed decisions to enhance the productivity of citizen developers, align digital transformation strategies, and foster innovation.},

In this context, we aim to highlight the evolution of the Citizen Development concept and the impact of Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms on business software development. These solutions democratize access to programming and allow users without formal technical knowledge to create agile software applications adaptable to various business scenarios. The progress of cloud computing, together with the need for rapid digital transformation and the increasing demand for software solutions, has accelerated the adoption of LCNC. However, the use of these platforms also involves challenges that may affect security, compliance with existing regulations, and the overall quality of applications. Thus, designing a hybrid collaboration model between software development teams and Citizen Development becomes essential for the successful implementation of applications created using these technologies. Despite the challenges, LCNC remains a suitable solution for innovation and digital transformation. The future may also rely on artificial intelligence integration, supporting agile development through intuitive interactions and enabling application creation via textual descriptions or even voice commands in natural language.},

Thus, multiple vendors have created low code development platforms to ease the use of low code development. However, current research on low code development platforms mainly focuses on the technological aspects of the platforms but not on their adoption. Hence, it remains unclear what drives and inhibits the adoption of low code development platforms. We conducted a literature review and identified thirteen factors that inhibit the adoption and seven factors that drive it. We structure these factors along with the diffusion of innovation framework that helps to disentangle drivers and inhibitors. As a result, we provide an initial explanation of the adoption of low code development platforms. Nevertheless, we conclude that existing research on the adoption of low code development platforms is not specific enough to understand the phenomenon substantially. Further, for some factors (e.g., cost), there is a disagreement in the academic literature on whether they are drivers or inhibitors. Hence, we identify gaps and derive avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
            Low-Code Development Plattformen (LCDPs) fördern die digitale Transformation von Organisationen, indem sie die Applikationsentwicklung durch FachbereichsmitarbeiterInnen ohne tiefgreifende Programmierkenntnisse – sogenannte Citizen Developer – ermöglichen. Marktforschungsinstitute prognostizieren, dass in den nächsten Jahren mehr als die Hälfte aller Applikationen mit LCDPs entwickelt werden. Nichtsdestotrotz stehen Organisationen vor der Herausforderung, sich für die richtigen Implementierungs- und Anwendungsansätze von LCDPs zu entscheiden. Dieser Artikel liefert daher ein umfassendes Bild über das praktische Verständnis und aktuelle Ansätze in verschiedenen Organisationen und leitet daraus Handlungsempfehlungen ab. Dafür wurden 16 Experteninterviews durchgeführt und wissenschaftlich analysiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Praxis grundsätzlich ein ähnliches Verständnis des Begriffs LCDP hat. Die Initiative für die Einführung kommt meist aus den Fachbereichen, die Entscheidung für oder gegen die LCDP-Implementierung wird jedoch meist von der Geschäftsführung in Kooperation mit der IT-Abteilung getroffen. Dabei unterscheiden sich die aktuellen Anwendungsansätze: Unternehmen nutzen entweder einen Self-Service-Ansatz durch die Fachbereiche oder integrieren die Entscheidung über eine potenzielle LCDP-Entwicklung durch die Citizen Developer in das bestehende Demand-Management der IT-Abteilung. Eine etablierte und adaptive Governance ist für beide Ansätze eine wichtige Voraussetzung. Die Erkenntnisse des Beitrags tragen zur wissenschaftlichen Diskussion bei, da dieser Artikel eine der ersten umfassenden und wissenschaftlich fundierten qualitativen Analysen über aktuelle praktische Adoptionsansätze der Praxis liefert. PraktikerInnen erfahren zudem, wie andere Unternehmen mit aktuellen Herausforderungen umgehen und welche Ansätze erfolgversprechend sind.

            Abstract
            Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) foster digital transformation of organizations by enabling application development through business users without in-depth programming skills—so-called citizen developers. Market research institutes predict that more than half of all applications will be developed using LCDPs in the next few years. Nevertheless, organizations face the challenge of deciding on suitable implementation and application approaches for LCDPs. This paper therefore provides a holistic picture of the practical understanding and current approaches in different organizations and derives recommendations for action. To this end, 16 expert interviews were scientifically conducted and analyzed. The results show that practitioners generally have a similar understanding of the term LCDP. The initiative for the introduction usually comes from the business departments, although the decision for or against LCDP implementation is made most of the time by the management board in cooperation with the IT department. Thereby, current application approaches differ: companies either use a self-service approach by the business departments or integrate the decision on potential LCDP development by the citizen developers into the existing demand management of the IT department. Established and adaptive governance is an important prerequisite for both approaches. The findings contribute to the scientific discussion, as this paper provides one of the first comprehensive and scientifically sound qualitative analyses of current adoption approaches in practice. Practitioners also learn how other organizations are dealing with current challenges and what approaches show promise.},

            In dem semantisch reichhaltigen Gebiet der konzeptionellen Modellierung besteht ein Bedarf an offenen und benutzerfreundlichen Plattformen zur Entwicklung von Modellierungswerkzeugen. Dieser Bedarf ergibt sich aus dem stetigen Wandel von etablierten Modellierungsstandards (z. B. BPMN, UML, ArchiMate) sowie domänenspezifischen Anforderungen. In der Anwendung manifestieren sich derartige Anpassungen bei der Realisierung von Unternehmensinformationssystemen, die sich auch angesichts technischer Herausforderungen kontinuierlich weiterentwickeln. Dieser Beitrag präsentiert einen konzeptionellen Low-Code-Ansatz für Open-Source-Metamodellierungsplattformen, der auf Basis von ADOxx prototypisch umgesetzt ist. Hierbei spielen Low-Code-Konzepte wie visuelle Drag-and-Drop-Editoren, Point-and-Click-Interaktionen, sowie das Prinzip der Wiederverwendung eine zentrale Rolle. Letzteres ermöglicht eine effiziente Integration von unterschiedlichsten Komponenten existierender Implementierungen, die auf Basis von über 50 bereits entwickelten Modellierungswerkzeugen zusammengetragen wurden. Die entsprechenden Anforderungen, die sich für den vorgestellten Ansatz ergeben, basieren auf einem evolutionären Entwicklungsprozess, der sich aus den mit verschiedenen Versionen der Plattform entwickelten Werkzeugen ableitet. Der Anspruch an Low-Code-Metamodellierungsplattformen ist die intuitive Realisierung von domänenspezifischen Modellierungswerkzeugen und die gleichzeitige Etablierung neuer Entwicklungsverfahren in der konzeptionellen Modellierung. Die Verwirklichung dieses erhobenen Anspruches steht im Einklang mit den aktuellen Trends im Bereich von Low-Code-Entwicklungsplattformen, welche durch die fortlaufende Anpassung an fortgeschrittene Funktionalitäten – wie die Integration von externen Diensten und Sicherheitsmechanismen, die zuvor primär durch traditionelle Programmierung umgesetzt wurden – vorangetrieben werden.

            Abstract
            In the semantically rich field of conceptual modeling, there is a need for open and user-friendly platforms for the development of modeling tools. This need arises from the constant change in both established modeling standards (e.g., BPMN, UML, ArchiMate) and domain-specific requirements. In application, such adaptations manifest themselves in the realization of enterprise information systems, which are constantly evolving in the face of technical challenges. This article presents a conceptual low-code approach for open-source metamodeling platforms, which is prototypically implemented on the basis of ADOxx. Low-code concepts such as visual drag-and-drop editors, point-and-click interactions, and the principle of reuse play a central role here. The latter enables the efficient integration of a wide variety of components from existing implementations, which have been compiled on the basis of over 50 modeling tools that have already been developed. The corresponding requirements that arise for the approach presented are based on an evolutionary development process that is derived from the tools developed with different versions of the platform. The requirement for low-code metamodeling platforms is the intuitive realization of domain-specific modeling tools and the simultaneous establishment of new development processes in conceptual modeling. The realization of this claim is in line with current trends in the field of low-code development platforms, which are driven by the ongoing adaptation to advanced functionalities—such as the integration of external services and security mechanisms that were previously implemented primarily through traditional programming.},

            In der schnelllebigen Geschäftswelt von heute ist es für Unternehmen entscheidend, sich rasch an veränderte Marktbedingungen anzupassen, um ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu sichern. Flexibilität und maßgeschneiderte Prozesse sind dabei zentrale Erfolgsfaktoren, die oft über die Möglichkeiten standardisierter Anwendungssysteme hinausgehen. Low-Code-Plattformen (LCP) wie Mendix und Outsystems sowie No-Code-Plattformen (NCP) wie Bubble bieten vielversprechende Ansätze zur Realisierung individueller Anpassungen durch visuelle und deklarative Techniken, die herkömmliche Programmierung ersetzen.
            Vor der Adoption einer solchen Plattform müssen Unternehmen beurteilen, wie gut eine spezifische LCP/NCP ihre individuellen Anforderungen erfüllen kann. Der mögliche Anforderungserfüllungsgrad hängt nicht nur von den Grundfunktionen einer Platform ab, sondern insbesondere von den verfügbaren Erweiterungen im Plattform-Ökosystem. Add-on-Stores bieten Zugang zu spezialisierten Erweiterungen, die die Grundfunktionen der Plattformen ergänzen und an spezifische Unternehmens-bedürfnisse anpassen können.
            Um die Eignung einer LCP/NCP für spezielle Anwendungsfälle zu bewerten, entwickelt dieser Beitrag ein Messinstrument zur Erfassung der Komplexität von Add-on-Stores unter Anwendung der Design Science Research Methode (DSR). Die Bewertung basiert auf der Analyse von 1483 Add-ons aus den Add-on-Stores von Microsoft Power Apps, Outsystems und Pega. Dieses Instrument ermöglicht es Unternehmen, die Vielfalt und Tiefe der verfügbaren Add-ons zu erfassen und somit fundierte Entscheidungen darüber zu treffen, ob eine LCP/NCP adoptiert werden soll. Dieser Beitrag unterstützt somit die Optimierung der Entscheidungsfindung bei der Auswahl von LCP/NCP.

            Abstract
            In today’s fast-moving business world, it is crucial for companies to adapt quickly to changing market conditions in order to remain competitive. Flexibility and customised processes are key success factors that often go beyond the capabilities of standardised application systems. Low-code platforms (LCP) such as Mendix and Outsystems as well as no-code platforms (NCP) such as Bubble offer promising approaches for realising individual adaptations using visual and declarative techniques that replace conventional programming.
            Before adopting such a platform, companies should assess how well a specific LCP/NCP can fulfil their individual requirements. The ability of the platforms to address individual needs depends not only on the core functions, but especially on the available extensions in the platform ecosystem. Add-on stores provide access to specialised extensions that complement the basic functions of the platforms and can be adapted to specific business needs.
            In order to assess the suitability of an LCP/NCP for specific use cases, this paper develops a measurement tool to capture the complexity of add-on stores using the Design Science Research Method (DSR). The assessment is based on the analysis of 1483 add-ons from the add-on stores of Microsoft Power Apps, Outsystems and Pega. This tool enables organisations to understand the variety and depth of available add-ons and thus make informed decisions about whether to adopt an LCP/NCP. This article thus supports the optimisation of decision-making when selecting LCP/NCP.},

            Abstract
            Low-code development platforms are increasingly pivotal in the digital transformation of businesses. These platforms enable the creation of software applications with minimal coding effort, reducing the complexity of software development and involving personnel from non-IT business areas in application development. This foundational article explores the principles, benefits, and challenges of low-code development. It illustrates how low-code platforms drive business innovation by enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of software development and enabling quicker adaptation to market changes. Our analysis is based on extensive literature research and over 30 interviews with representatives from more than 20 companies. The findings highlight that low-code platforms not only reduce development time and costs but also foster a culture of innovation and collaboration within organizations. Additionally, we present specific recommendations necessary for the successful implementation of low-code platforms. Finally, we provide an outlook on future research topics, including the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into low-code platforms to further maximize their potential.},

            Abstract
            This case study outlines the development of a prototype designed to minimise consumer returns by supporting customer service agents in offering tailored discounts that shall incentivise the customers to retain their purchases. The prototype is based on an AI model, namely Case-Based Reasoning, integrated within a user-friendly web application to enhance usability. Utilising the low-code technology myCBR had enabled a rapid development, while still maintaining a low-cost implementation. The effectiveness of the prototype was validated under authentic conditions by customer service agents from a cooperating German retailer for furniture and home accessories. The results confirm that the prototype systematically uses existing customer service data to create sufficient discount offers that are both efficient and cost-effective. By implementing data-driven discount strategies, the processing of customer enquiries is optimised and unnecessary returns are proactively avoided. As a result, the prototype’s approach can contribute significantly to sustainability, cost reduction, and conservation of resources.},

            Anhand eines Herstellers von Maschinenkomponenten wird gezeigt, welche Rolle Low-Code-Ansätze für die digitale Transformation in mittelständischen Unternehmen spielen. Mit einer Low-Code Integrationsplattform wurden die bereits vorhandenen jedoch isolierten Daten und Informationen im Unternehmen aufgabenorientiert aus den verschiedenen IT-Systemen erschlossen und zusammengeführt. Mittels APIs und ansprechenden Frontends wurden diese Daten für die verschiedenen Stakeholder (Kunden, Servicepartner, interne Vertriebs- und Serviceabteilungen) spezifisch aufbereitet und als digitaler Produktpass bereitgestellt. Durch den Einsatz von Low-Code-Ansätzen betrug der Aufwand dafür insgesamt nur 20 Personentage.
            Der Beitrag liefert zunächst eine Begriffsbildung und gibt anschließend einen Einblick in die Konzeption und Umsetzung des digitalen Produktpasses, diskutiert anhand konkreter Szenarien Grenzen von Low-Code-Ansätzen und zeigt Lösungsansätze auf. Ein Ausblick auf den Zusammenhang von Low-Code und künstlicher Intelligenz rundet den Beitrag ab.

            Abstract
            Medium-sized companies are under enormous market pressure. They are caught between the conflicting priorities of increasing customer requirements, a growing shortage of skilled workers and complex legal framework conditions, including in relation to cybersecurity, sustainability and due diligence obligations regarding human rights and climate protection. Digitalization and automation of business processes promise to reduce this pressure on companies, meet the requirements of various stakeholders in less time and gain freedom for strategic action.
            A manufacturer of machine components is used to demonstrate the role that low-code approaches play in the digital transformation of medium-sized companies. Using a low-code integration platform, the existing but isolated data and information in the company was accessed and merged from the various IT systems in a task-oriented manner. Using APIs and appealing front ends, this data was specifically prepared for the various stakeholders (customers, service partners, internal sales and service departments) and made available as a digital product passport. Thanks to the use of low-code approaches, the total effort required was only 20 man-days.
            The article first provides a definition of the term and then gives an insight into the conception and implementation of the digital product passport, discusses the limits of low-code approaches using concrete scenarios and shows possible solutions. An outlook on the connection between low-code and artificial intelligence rounds off the article.},

            Der anhaltende Mangel an Fachkräften in der IT-Branche stellt eine zentrale Herausforderung für Unternehmen dar und erschwert den Fortschritt bei der digitalen Transformation. Infolgedessen gewinnt der Einsatz von Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) sowohl in der Praxis als auch in der Wissenschaft zunehmend an Interesse, um auch Mitarbeiter außerhalb der IT-Abteilung dazu zu befähigen, als sog. Business Unit Developer eigenständig Digitalisierungs- und Automatisierungslösungen zu entwickeln. Bisher konzentriert sich die wissenschaftliche Literatur auf die technischen Aspekte von LCNC, während Fragen zur optimalen Einführung in Unternehmen unbeantwortet bleiben. Diese Forschungsarbeit untersucht die praktische Implementierung von Business Unit Development Programmen in Unternehmen, um Auswirkungen auf beteiligte Mitarbeitende zu identifizieren. In Kooperation mit den Stadtwerken München (SWM) wurde eine umfassende Einzelfallstudie durchgeführt, bei der die Umsetzung einer Business Unit Development Initiative untersucht wurde. Die Ergebnisse zeigen unter anderem, wie das Business Unit Development von teilnehmenden Mitarbeitern wahrgenommen wird sowie welche individuellen Vorteile sich für diese ergeben. Zudem wird ersichtlich, mit welchen Herausforderungen Mitarbeitende im Rahmen des Business Unit Developments konfrontiert sind und wie sich die Entwicklung und der Einsatz von LCNC-Anwendungen auf deren Arbeitsalltag auswirkt. Die Ergebnisse tragen zu einem besseren Verständnis über den praktischen Einsatz von LCNC in Unternehmen bei und zeigen neue Forschungsfelder auf. Zudem können die Ergebnisse Unternehmen dabei unterstützen, organisatorische und strategische Entscheidungen im Rahmen des Aufbaus und der Skalierung einer Business Unit Development Initiative zu treffen.

            Abstract
            The ongoing shortage of skilled workers in the IT sector is a key challenge for companies and is hampering progress in the digital transformation. As a result, the use of low-code/no-code (LCNC) is gaining increasing interest both in practice and in science to enable non-IT-employees to independently develop digitization and automation solutions as so-called business unit developers. So far, the scientific literature has focused on the technical aspects of LCNC, while questions about the optimal introduction in companies remain unanswered. This research examines the practical implementation of business unit development programs in companies to identify the effects on participating employees. In cooperation with Stadtwerke München (SWM) a comprehensive case study was conducted to investigate the implementation of a business unit development initiative. The results show how business unit development is perceived by participating employees and what individual benefits arise for them. Furthermore, they reveal challenges employees face in the context of business unit development and how the development and use of LCNC applications affects their day-to-day work. The results contribute to a better understanding of the practical use of LCNC in companies and point to new fields of research. In addition, the results can support companies in making organizational and strategic decisions in the context of setting up and scaling a business unit development initiative.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
            Moderne Low-Code/No-Code-Plattformen transformieren die Art und Weise, wie Unternehmen digitale Lösungen entwickeln und Innovationen voranbringen. Durch den Fortschritt in Technologien wie Cloud-Computing, künstlicher Intelligenz und maschinellem Lernen ermöglichen diese Plattformen Fachbereichsmitarbeitern ohne umfassende IT-Kenntnisse – den sogenannten Citizen Developern – das Entwerfen und Implementieren eigener leichtgewichtiger digitaler Lösungen. Dieser Trend motiviert immer mehr Unternehmen, Citizen Development-Initiativen ins Leben zu rufen und somit einen kulturellen Wandel hin zu einer demokratisierten Entwicklung digitaler Innovationen zu fördern. Trotz des erkennbaren Potenzials stehen viele Unternehmen jedoch vor der Frage, wie sie ihre Citizen Development-Initiativen effektiv starten und unternehmensweit skalieren können. Dieser Artikel beleuchtet diese Fragestellung basierend auf Interviews mit 21 Verantwortlichen für Citizen Development aus 16 verschiedenen Unternehmen, die früh in Low-Code/No-Code investiert haben. Wir identifizieren vier Phasen, die Unternehmen im Rahmen von Citizen Development durchlaufen, und die spezifischen Herausforderungen, die in jeder Phase bewältigt werden müssen. Unsere Forschungsergebnisse eröffnen Unternehmen Einblicke in aktuelle Praktiken und Zielzustände, um die Herausforderungen einer erfolgreichen Implementierung von Citizen Development zu meistern. Unternehmen sollen befähigt werden, ihre Ressourcen effizienter zu nutzen und Citizen Development nahtlos in ihre Digitalstrategie zu integrieren.

            Abstract
            Modern low-code/no-code platforms are transforming the way companies develop digital solutions and drive innovation. With advancements in technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, these platforms enable business employees without extensive IT knowledge—known as citizen developers—to design and implement their own lightweight digital solutions. This trend is motivating an increasing number of companies to launch Citizen Development initiatives, thus promoting a cultural shift towards democratized development and delivery of digital innovations. Despite the apparent potential, many companies are faced with the question of how to effectively launch and scale their Citizen Development initiatives across the organization. This article sheds light on this challenge based on interviews with 21 individuals responsible for Citizen Development initiatives from 16 different companies that have invested early in low-code/no-code. We identify four distinct phases that companies navigate in the context of Citizen Development, alongside the unique challenges encountered in each phase. Our research findings provide companies with insights into current practices to master the obstacles of successfully implementing Citizen Development. Companies should be empowered to use their resources more efficiently and integrate Citizen Development seamlessly into their digital strategy.},

Here, we present an approach to address this challenge by using no-code AI in a course for university students with diverse educational backgrounds. This approach was tested in an empirical, case-based educational setting, in which students engaged in data collection and trained ML models using a no-code AI platform. In addition, a framework consisting of five principles of instruction (problem-centered learning, activation, demonstration, application, and integration) was applied. This paper contributes to the literature on IS education by providing information for instructors on how to incorporate nocode AI in their courses and insights into the benefits and challenges of using no-code AI tools to support the ML workflow in educational settings.},

With the central role of digital technology in contemporary organizations and the challenges of outsourcing strategies, including unmet organizational expectations and the necessity for inhouse competence, we explore the integration of low-code development—a development approach requiring minimal coding skills—as a new Information Systems (IS) sourcing approach. By conducting a qualitative case study within a large Scandinavian municipality’s development unit, we examine how low-code development facilitates the backsourcing of information systems. Our case study focuses on two teams that successfully replaced vendor-built systems with internally developed ones, leveraging their contextual knowledge of the services they were supporting. This research contributes to the IS field by conceptualizing low-code driven backsourcing as a significant phenomenon. We discuss its impact on sourcing strategies and address the call for more insights into the backsourcing process from a public sector perspective. Through our analysis, we identify characteristics of using low-code for IS backsourcing and propose future research avenues to further understand the implications of this phenomenon.},

Yet, research lacks an understanding of how challenges related to SMEs' roles and responsibilities unfold and how to address these challenges when executing decentralized RPA projects. To this end, our study employs a Design Science Research approach, drawing on literature and 14 expert interviews, to (1) systematically synthesize the challenges related to SMEs' roles and responsibilities and (2) derive a software development framework for supporting SMEs in their new roles and responsibilities in decentralized RPA projects. Thus, our study contributes to RPA and low-code development research and provides SMEs with guidelines to navigate decentralized RPA projects in practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Citizen developers and low-code platforms considerably change how software is created because the development of business applications transgresses the boundaries of organizational IT departments. With these changes, a new generation of developers must be trained. Such training is considered the responsibility of higher education institutions that enthusiastically adopt practice-based and experiential learning approaches. At the core, the focus is on real-world experiences and practical problem-solving, albeit with growing concerns about limiting deep learning and metacognitive reflections. Ample educational research highlights that metacognition is essential for students to be workplace-ready, but very little research has investigated the impact of practice-based learning on metacognitive reflections. This study draws on experiential learning theory to examine the influence of experiences in a low-code systems development project on metacognitive thinking. In a quantitative study using a survey, the effects of experiential learning factors (i.e., authenticity, active learning, self-relevance, and utility) and a team-based learning factor on metacognitive reflections are tested. Results show that when citizen developers create business applications, the experiential learning factors positively impact metacognitive reflections. However, team-based learning only positively moderates the relationship between self-relevance and reflections, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between authenticity and reflections. Taken as a whole, the study's contributions suggest that practice-based learning using low-code platforms under the citizen developer method is an effective way to train IT talents with needed context and life-long self-learning skills.},

	abstract = {Industry-based certifications (IBC) are one way to provide credentials to learners in Higher Education Institutions (HEI) with product-specific skills (e.g., Low-Code development) that can complement academic degrees (e.g., Business Informatics). To understand the ecosystem of industry-based certifications in the context of HEI, we first visualize stakeholders using the influence and affected features of a rainbow diagram. In this opinion paper, we draw on our personal experiences to understand the opportunities and challenges stakeholders face through the lens of Curriculum Theory to determine that IBC is a recognized way of learning IT skills in a Higher Education Institution. By applying a case study in an Australian university, we explore the challenges and potential of IBC to create value (social, functional, and emotional) to stakeholders in the ecosystem. We will discuss how we integrated the Low-Code development content in an undergraduate and postgraduate course at a mid-sized university. We make several recommendations that could be adopted by stakeholders to drive strategic decision-making.},

	abstract = {Low-code platforms can provide a learning environment that integrates academic theory with practical experiences, allowing students to experience real-world ISD projects. Such a pedagogy is known as work-integrated learning (WIL). In a low-code WIL course, the focus is on the practical development experiences and the delivery of a business application based on client’s requirements. Yet, the real-world ISD experiences may inhibit metacognition, which is essential for students to succeed in future learning of digital innovations. Without metacognition, students struggle to learn how to learn and be reﬂective about their learning. This study uses a mixed-method design and draws on Flavell’s (1979) theoretical framework to examine metacognition in the context of low-code WIL. In particular, the study examines the effect of learner-oriented factors and task-oriented factors on metacognition and its impact on learning outcomes, such as knowledge conﬁdence, app delivery, and grade. The quantitative results indicate that metacognition is inﬂuenced by motivation, the strategic approach, and autonomy, whereas self-efﬁcacy beliefs have no effect. The learning outcomes are also achieved. Qualitative results (students’ essays and apps) corroborate the quantitative results while also providing additional insights into the learning in low-code WIL showing the impact of the platform and agile ISD practices on metacognition. Overall, this study offers IS educators a better understanding of how low-code platforms can foster learning-to-learn while providing real-world practical experiences.},

As a response, many companies are adopting low-code and no-code approaches to cultivate and empower a new cohort of employees: the citizen developers. While the practice community has been discussing the Citizen Development phenomenon for some time now, research lags behind, leading to a dearth of conceptual clarity in understanding the terms low-code, no-code, and Citizen Development. This paper connects the dots and proposes a more harmonized conceptual understanding of these related but distinct terms. Additionally, we explore the practical difficulties associated with Citizen Development approaches as identified by professionals in the field. Our key contribution is a clearer terminology and understanding of Citizen Development that can enhance both scholarly inquiry and practical application, facilitating clearer communication and more precise discussions.},

While people can use foundation models through chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT), chat, regardless of the capabilities of the underlying models, is not a production tool for building reusable AI services. APIs like LangChain allow for LLM-based application development but require substantial programming knowledge, thus posing a barrier. To mitigate this, we systematically review, summarise, refine and extend the concept of AI chain by incorporating the best principles and practices that have been accumulated in software engineering for decades into AI chain engineering, to systematize AI chain engineering methodology.

Given that low-code is an emerging research phenomenon, there is little understanding of its origins, adoption motives and approaches, and its ecosystem. In my PhD thesis, I use qualitative and visualization methods to address these research gaps. My work has five contributions. First, I developed an intellectual map of the low-code literature and identified related research streams. Second, I created a model underscoring aspects that support or hinder low-code adoption.
